Allow users to serve webpages from home directory

Edit httpd.conf to enable userdir:
	nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Make the following edits:
	Inside nano:
	ctrl+W to search: UserDir

	Comment out line UserDir disable
	#UserDir disable

	Uncomment public_html line:
	ctrl+W to search: public_html
	
	Remove # from line:
	UserDir public_html

As root, access a user home folder and create html directory:
	su -
	cd ~<user>
	mkdir public_html	

Change home folder permissions to allow reads:
	chmod 711 ~<user>

Change public_html permissions to be accessed as requested:
	chmod 755 public_html

Create an index file for that user:
	nano public_html/index.html
	Write page

Fix SELinux conditions to allow external access:
	chcon -R -h -t httpd_sys_content_t public_html
	chcon -t httpd_sys_content_t public_html/index.html

Restart apache after httpd.conf changes:
	service httpd restart
