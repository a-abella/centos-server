Download and run Lmbench bencharking utility

Download tarball to desired directory:
	cd /path/to/dir
	wget http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~osorioj/lmbench-3.0-a8.tgz

Untar contents to desired directory:
	tar zxvf lmbench-3.0-a8.tgz

Make the applciation:
	cd lmbench-3.0-a8
	make

Run the benchmark:
	make results
	NOTE: select defaults during all prompts except the final. Select Mail Setup - NO
	Benchmark will run for many minutes

Change to old kernel:
	Reboot
	Select old kernel in GRUB menu

Run benchamrk again:
	cd /path/to/dir/lmbench-3.0-a8
	make results

View results in file:
	cat results/i686-pc-linux-gnu/<any file>
	cat results/summary.out


Results:
	We have chosen to remain with the custom kernel. However, as can be seen in summary.out, the becnhmark had to be run four times. This is because it crashed due to low memory twice. As a result, I do not feel supremely confident in the accuracy of the benchmark. We choose the custom kernel on the basis of the reported latency figures being about on par with the old kernel, and sometimes lower.
