Download and run a security audit utility
NOTE: Due to the package being very out of date, we replaced Bastille with Lynis

Choose a holding directory
Lynis does not require isntallation, it runs from whatever location it exists in:
	mkdir /usr/local/lynis
	cd /usr/local/lynis

Download Lynis:
	wget http://www.rootkit.nl/files/lynis-1.3.0.tar.gz
	tar -xvf lynis-1.3.0.tar.gz

Running Lynis:
	cd lynis-1.3.0
	./lynis

Processing:
	Run witout options to print isntructions.
	To begin audit of entire system, run:
		./lynis -c -Q
	
	Note: the -Q option can be used to skip all "Press Enter to continue" prompts.


Audit will run over time and display results to terminal.
A log of the scan is available at /var/log/lynis-report.dat
