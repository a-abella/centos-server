From my observations of the in/out bound packets output from the executions of tethereal, I've concluded 
that when one connects to a web server through SSH via PuTTY, the packets are encrypted so that the 
connection is secure, and the source IP and the destination IP often alternate in order to guarantee the 
connection through the use of TCP handshaking, with one of the IPs being the actual server port. Then a 
few broadcast packets are sent out through VMWare. When connecting to a web browser, not only did I 
trace the HTTP packets, but also the TCP packets that made for realiability in the connection to the 
browser. When I pinged google.com, four packets were transmitted and received, with none of them being 
lost, meaning that google.com is reliable. For the FTP file transfer, I used WinSCP which is an FTP 
client, and I transfered a file from the web server itself to its host, which is my computer, and 
several SSH request/response packets were captured, which were created during the FTP file transfer.
