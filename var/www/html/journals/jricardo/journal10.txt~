10-8-14: Enabled User Quotas and set limits

HOW-TO:

Open the fstab file in the /etc directory:

nano /etc/fstab

To enable user quotas for a file system, such as /dev/sdc2, go to the 
fourth argument marked "default" and change it to "default,usrquota".

Then, remount the file system after saving the /etc/fstab file so the 
changes take effect, with the following command:

mount -o remount /dev/sdc2

Then, soft and/or hard limits can be set for each user by editing a 
user's quotas with the following command (profe is the user):

edquota profe

Or one can use the following command:

setquota -u user [soft int] [hard int] [soft int] [hard int] -a 
/dev/loop0
(i.e. "setquota -u profe 100 200 10 15 -a /dev/loop0")

Changes can then be tested with the following command (profe is user):

quota profe

A report for user quotas can be generated with any the following 
commands:

repquota /dev/sdc2
repquota /ext3part

This is an example of a quota report, documented from a report that I 
generated after making a few changes to the user limits and using the 
"edquota [user]" command:

Disk quotas for user profe (uid 600):
  Filesystem                   blocks       soft       hard     inodes     
soft     hard
  /dev/sdc2                         0        100        200          0       
10       15

Disk quotas for user antonio (uid 601):
  Filesystem                   blocks       soft       hard     inodes     
soft     hard
  /dev/sdc2                         0        100        200          0       
10       15
                      0        100        200          0       10       
15
Disk quotas for user ricardo (uid 602):
  Filesystem                   blocks       soft       hard     inodes     
soft     hard
  /dev/sdc2                         0        100        200          0       
10       15

After remounting the filesystem with user quotas enabled, the following 

commands must be run (quota must be turned off first):

quotacheck -ua
restorecon /ext3part/aquota*
quotaon -a
