9-22-14: Downloaded, installed, and configured GlassFish Server on the 
VM.

HOW-TO:

Run these commands:

wget  
http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/glassfish/4.0/release/glassfish-4.0.zip
unzip glassfish-4.0.zip

For space efficiency, we delete the zip file:

rm glassfish-4.0.zip 

Then open ports 4848 and 8888.

nano /etc/sysconfig/iptables

Add the following lines to iptables:

-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 4848 
-j ACCEPT
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 8888 
-j ACCEPT

Restart iptables:

service iptables restart

To change default port to 8888:

cd glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/config
nano domain.xml

Find the following line:

<network-listener port="8080" protocol="http-listener-1" transport="tcp" 
name="http-

listener-1" thread-pool="http-thread-pool"></network-listener>

Change the port 8080 to 8888.

Then, start Glassfish by running the following command from the main 
directory. Command 

path may vary with the directory as long as the user is in one of the 
right 

subdirectories.

./glassfish4/bin/asadmin start-domain

This command can be used to stop Glassfish:

./glassfish4/bin/asadamin stop-domain domain1

To change the admin password through command line, use the following 
command:

cd glassfish4/bin/asadmin
./asadmin change-admin-password --domain_name domain1

The default password is blank, so just hit enter if changing the 
password for the first 

time. To access DAS remotely, run this command:

./asadmin enable-secure-admin --port 4848

Enter the username (admin) and the password. Then restart the server 
with the following 

command:

reboot

Access the GlassFish Web Console with a browser.
