10-2-14: Installed Ruby

HOW-TO:

Use the following commands:

sudo yum install ruby ruby-rdoc ruby-devel

"ruby-rdoc" and "ruby-devel" are ruby dependencies that help ruby run 
more 

smoothly.

To install RubyGems, another dependency, use the following commands:

wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/69365/rubygems-1.3.6.tgz
tar -zxvf rubygems-1.3.6.tgz
sudo ruby setup.rb
