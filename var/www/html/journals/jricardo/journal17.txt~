11-3-14: Exported Samba

HOW-TO:

All the Step-by-Step instructions were provided for us by the professor 
and are avaliable here:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective: Install Samba and setup two shares off your linux box, then
access these shares with the 'smbclient' command as guest and one of
the user accounts.
 
Install Samba:
 
# yum install samba
# yum install samba-common
# yum install samba-client
 
 
Check if Samba (or smb) is on, enabled it, and then start the service:
 
# chkconfig --list | grep smb
# chkconfig smb on
# service smb status
# service smb start
 
Create Samba user accounts from the Unix accounts, set password for
a real user on the system (e.g. joe):
 
# cd /etc/samba
# smbpasswd â€“a joe
 
Install SWAT to configure and manage Samba; SWAT uses xinetd to run:
 
# yum install samba-swat
# chkconfig --list | grep xinetd
# chkconfig xinetd on
 
Edit xinetd SWAT configuration to enable SWAT:
 
# vi /etc/xinetd.d/swat set 'disable=no' (was disable=yes)
# service xinetd start
 
 
Open firewall ports for Samba, SWAT (port 901):
 
# edit /etc/sysconfig/iptables by hand
 
 
Create a directory /home/shared, then make it guest available as SHARED
 
# mkdir /home/shared
 
 
Set up Samba share:
 
Open browser, navigate to http://localhost:901 (SWAT Tool).
Click on 'Global', change workgroup to CTS4348.
Click Commit Change.
Click on 'Shares'.
Type in new share 'SHARED' and then click 'Create new Share'.
Click on 'Shares' again.
Select 'SHARED' from the selection box, then 'Change Share'.
Set the 'path' option to '/home/shared'.
Set 'guest ok' to 'yes'.
Set 'available' to 'yes'.
Click on 'Commit Changes'.
 
(Rather than using the web interface, you could alternatively edit
/etc/samba/smb.conf manually to add a new share. Make sure to run
testparm on the modified config.)
 
 
Verify your work: See what shares are available on your Samba server
using user joe:
 
# smbclient -L //localhost -U joe
 
 
Connect to the public SHARED folder as user guest:
 
# smbclient //localhost/SHARED -U guest
 
 
Conect to joe's home directory on the linux system (homes share) over
Samba:
 
# smbclient //localhost/joe -U joe
 
(Since SELinux default policy does not allow this, override with:
/usr/sbin/setsebool -P samba_enable_home_dirs=1)
