10-31-14: Enabled FTP Services

HOW-TO:

First, install VSFTP with the following command:

yum install vsftpd

Make a backup of the vsftpd.conf file in /etc/vsftpd:

cp /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf.backup

By default, anonymous users should be able to use FTP, which 

means that the following should not be changed:

anonymous_enable=YES

However to allow anonymous users to upload files, the 

following line needs to be uncommented:

anon_upload_enable=YES

Anonymous users should also be able to download files after 

doing this.

To jail anonymous access, we create a directory for anonymous 

uploads/downloads and add it to vsftpd.conf:

mkdir /var/ftp/pub/anon

Add the following line to vsftpd.conf:

anon_root=/var/ftp/pub/anon

To set up a user account with FTP access so that they can 

upload/download files from their respective home directories, 

we do the following:

Run the following commands:

mkdir /home/user/file

For each user, replacing user with the name of the user, then 

add a password for each user:

htpasswd -c /etc/vsftpd/passwd user

Finally, we add the following line to vsftpd.conf:

chroot_local_enable=YES
