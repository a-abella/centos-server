10-29-14: Installed Wireshark (Ethereal) and did the Exercises.

HOW-TO:

yum install ethereal-gnome

To execute this tool, we use the following command:

tethereal

Exercises:

For Exercise 1 and 2 we start up tethereal and redirecting the output to a text file. We do this with 
the following command:

tethereal > filename.txt

Exercise 1: After running the above command, we logon to the server through SSH with PuTTY (If an 
instance of PuTTY is already running the capture, we open another instance). Then we stop capturing 
(Ctrl+C) and trace all the inbound/outbound packets from the ssh interactions.

Exercise 2: After running the command above ExercWe start up Internet Explorer or Firefox and go to our 
Drupal/Wordpress portal and perform tasks and browsing. After capturing, we trace inbound/outbound 
packets from the http intractions between the browser and portal.

Exercise 3: We ping google.com and trace the in/out packets resulting from the pinging, then we stop 
pinging. We do this by running the following command:

ping google.com

(It is recommended that the pings are saved for future reference, we do this by running: "ping 
google.com > filename.txt")

Exercise 4: With a Linux Virtual Machine (or WinSCP as it is an FTP Client) we perform a file transfer 
using FTP. We then use this FTP service to transfer a file to the host (performing a file transfer). 
Then we trace in-bound/out-bound packets from the ftp interaction.


With regard to the exercises, I have written a small summary explaining the observations for the trail 
of in/out bound packets from each interaction between the server and the other end from each exercise, 
and it is avaliable on the group portal.
