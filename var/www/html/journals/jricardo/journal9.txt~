10-1-14: Downloaded and compiled lmbench benckmarking suite.

HOW-TO:

First download the source tgz with the following command:

wget http://www.cs.fiu.edu/~osorioj/lmbench-3.0-a8.tgz

Restore the contents of the file, go into the directory, and compile the 
application. 

First make a directory for it.

mkdir lmbench
mv lmbench-3.0-a8.tgz lmbench
cd lmbench
tar -xzf lmbench-3.0-a8.tgz
cd lmbench-3.0-a8
make

Open the README file and follow its instructions. Set defaults for the 
program to run.

nano README

After this, reboot to another kernel and repeat the steps in the README 
file (run the 

benchmark again).

After running the benchmark on both kernels, create a summary report.

cd lmbench-3.0-a8
make see

Go to the summary.out file that contains the comparison report.

cd results/summary.out
