10-16-14: Created a Database for Wordpress

HOW-TO:

Enter the following command followed by the root password.

mysql –u root –p

Once in MySQL, run the following SQL commands:

mysql> CREATE DATABASE [database_name]
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON [database_name].* TO 

"[wordpress_username]"@"[hostname]" IDENTIFIED BY "[password]";
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> EXIT;

------------------------------------------------------------
Relocated MySQL Data files to XFS/JFS.

HOW-TO:

Run the following commands, with "destination_filesystem" being the 

directory for the filesystem:

service mysqld stop
rsync -avz /var/lib/mysql/ /destination_filesystem/mysql
chown mysql.mysql /destination_filesystem/mysql
chown mysql.mysql /var/www/html/mysql

Then add or change the value of MySQL configuration file to be mapped 
into the new directory (adding is reccomended).

nano /etc/my.cnf

Add or change the following line in the file under [mysqld], with 

"destination_filesystem" being the proper filesystem:

datadir = /destination_filesystem/mysql

Now start the MySQL service:

service mysqld start

In the mysql shell, run the following SQL command to verify the datadir 

variable in MySQL:

mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'datadir';
