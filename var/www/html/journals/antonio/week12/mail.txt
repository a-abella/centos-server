	| /usr/bin/vendor_perl/spamc

	# Messages with a 5 stars or higher spam level are going to be deleted right away
	# And since we never touch any inbox, no lockfile is needed.

	* ^X-Spam-Level: \*\*\*\*\*
	/dev/null

	# If a mail with spam-status:yes wasn't deleted by previous line, it could be a false positive. So its going to be sent to an spam mailbox instead.
	# Since we don't want the possibility of one procmail instance messing with another procmail instance, we use a lockfile
